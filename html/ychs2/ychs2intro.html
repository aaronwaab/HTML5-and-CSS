        <p>Yap Catholic High School is a rigorous college preparatory school (grades 9-12) which serves young men and women from the state of Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia. YCHS opened its doors in September of 2011 with thirty-five students. Small, safe, and faith-based, YCHS seeks to develop the minds, hearts, souls, and characters of students in their pursuit of becoming women and men for others.   YCHS currently serves 91 students from Yap Proper and the Neighboring Islands.  Our goal is to help students develop their God-given gifts so that they can use them in the service of others.  Our students strive to grow and be challenged as they work towards becoming the best possible versions of themselves.  We are located on a newly-developed, twenty-two acre rural campus in the village of Lamer, Rull on the island of Yap.</p>
